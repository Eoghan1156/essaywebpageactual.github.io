       <h2> <p>Wolfgang Weingart is a world renown German typographer who had an influential role in revolutionizing the field of typography with his teachings and new approaches to the craft. Weingart was born near Lake Constance, 1941 in Sothern Germany near the Swiss border. As a child, he grew up during World War II and was subject to the terror and fear the world was experiencing at the time. He began primary school in 1947 and from an early age, showed a rebellious attitude towards schooling. This rebellious nature generates itself in Weingart's refusal of traditional 'Swiss Typography' in pursuit of a more expressive, experimental use of Type. In 1954 he had a brief move to Lisbon, Portugal, however, he returned to Germany in 1956. As a young man, he first familiarised himself with the craft of typesetting and linotyping whilst attending the Merz Akademie in which he studied a two-year course in applied art and design, in Stuttgart from 1958 to 1960. Weingart found a particular passion for metal type, which kindled his passion for typography altogether. </p></h2>

       <h2><p> Once Weingart graduated, he decided to pursue an apprenticeship at the Ruwe Printing in Stuttgart as a typesetter. There, he met house designer Karl-August Hanke who urged Weingart to join the Basel School of Design as Hanke was a former student of the institution. In 1963 Weingart's apprenticeship had ended and thus decided to take Hanke's advice and traveled to Basel to enroll in the School. The same year he met fellow designers Hofmann and Ruder who urged Weingart to enroll in person. After Graduating in 1968 at the top of his class, Hofmann invited Weingart to teach at the school's newly established advanced graphic design program at the age of 27. The program itself was created to offer a more in-depth look at different forms of typography honing the skills of those who wanted to be future high-level designers. Hofman's choice in electing a young graduate was criticised but Weingart soon silenced critics with his revolutionary teachings on design, encouraging his students to never fall upon a single form of type but to branch out and experiment with different techniques, unshackling the limitations of type into boundless possibilities.</p></h2>

    <h2><p>Weingart continued to teach and inspire students until retiring in 2005. Weingart's innovative approach to typography is said to have been a key influential factor in the creation of 'Swiss Punk Typography' or 'New Wave'. His lectures were held in such high regard, during his career as a professor he was invited to teach all over the world including, the Yale Summer Program in Graphic Design in Brissago, Switzerland, at Hofman's invitation.He spread his influence on design and inspired students to indulge in the 'New Wave' of typography although never purposely ;"I took 'Swiss Typography' as my starting point, then I blew it apart, never forcing any style upon my students"-Weingart. Weingart also held exhibitions, his most famous in the 'Museum of design' in Zurich showing the still ever-present influence Weingart has over the field of Typography and Graphic Design. During Weingart's 40 years of teaching, he taught and influenced many famous designers in today's Graphic design industry. Those students included April Greiman, Franz Werner, Robert Probst, Jerry Kuyper, Emily Murphy and many more.

    <section><h2><p>Weingart's style broke the traditional rules of Swiss Typography and used letters in a way that had never been done before. He encouraged experimentation with letterforms to his students creating abstract pieces of art from simple shapes. This changed the Swiss Typography industry completely, with Weingarts 'New Wave' style influencing Typographers all over the world. Weingart taught his students to go beyond the restrictions of type and to open up to its potential for creativity. Diagonal lines, inconsistent spacing, layering, experimentation with tones and textures and implementation of photography can all be recognized within the style of Weingart's work.</p></h2></section>

    <section><h2> <p>Weingart upholds ideals of the importance of handcrafting Type and regards it as a key factor in the design process. Throughout his work, he uses Typesetting, Linotype and woodblock printing, traditional methods that require a great deal of care to truly perfect. Weingart taught his students the importance of the hands-on approach to design, as it creates an instant connection between the designer and the piece and none of the personality is lost" Electronic equipment replaces neither Eyes, Hands, nor Heart...". In the late 1960's, Weingart began using the letterpress which he regarded as the most simple form of printing, but also the easiest to manipulate and alter. Weingart developed a fascination with lithographic film, a substitute to the traditional paper as film provided endless possibilities and pushed the boundaries of Typography even further.</p></h2>

    <section><h2><p>Swiss Typography is a design movement that emerged from Germany and Switzerland in the 1920's. It was created as a form of type that expresses, cleanness, readability, and functionality. In a century involving two world wars, countries had to communicate with ease and enter new diplomatic relations, making clarity and objectiveness essential in such trying times. Thus Swiss Type found it's role to preserve objectivity within the type and to convey messages in a clear manner. Swiss Type restricts itself to grid layouts, emphasizing neatly spaced lettering and comfortability. Swiss Type includes  Helvetica, that Weingart openly displays distaste to "Anyone who uses Helvetica knows nothing about typefaces". The movement also umbrellas other fonts such as Univers, SangBleu-empire, and type containing sans-serif styles. Clear presented photography was a design element that was key to the Swiss Type movement as it held no bias towards a given subject and was free of propaganda, presenting information in a clear objective manner. Swiss Typography conveys order, preventing information from being warped or obscured to better benefit the social and communicative functions of society.  Swiss Typography's tedious use of structure was seen as a restriction to Weingart, to which he opposed its use in his teachings, and instead encouraged his students to express themselves using type and to push the limits of what type could truly accomplish. Many Swiss Typographers did not see themselves as designers although many believed the movement was an integral part in aiding the social</p></h2>

        <section><h2><p>'New Wave' rejected the traditional norms of Typography and pushed the boundaries of type. Designers inspired by Weingart indulged in different techniques exploring the endless possibilities of the newly found Typographical movement. The style defies the strict grid-based arrangement conventions of the ‘Swiss typography’, which at first caused uproar amongst the typographical profession but soon came to be realized as the opening up of new, more flexible ways of using Type. The New style encompassed Wolfgang's ideals, by using different letter weights, alienating single letters, curving lines and using different angles to obtain a required effect.</p></h2>
    
            <h2><p>The ‘New Wave’ stretches the limits of Type, and in a lot of cases, abandons all forms of legibility,  obscuring lettering to the point of sheer chaos. Weingart himself famously states, "What's the point in legibility when nothing makes you take notice of it".Typography evolved from being a mere way of presenting language, to a respected art form and a way for designers to express themselves. During Weingart's 40 years of teaching, he taught and influenced many famous designers in today's Graphic design industry. </p></h2>

    <section><h2><p>Weingart's most recognized piece was a 1984 exhibition poster labeled "The Matterhorn" where he came up with the ingenious idea to use a xerographic printing process to copy the angles of a crumpled handkerchief and embed the images on a sheet of lithographic film. He then experimented with overlapping copies of the film to create a range of tones and textures. In other pieces, Weingart openly deconstructs the rule set of 'Swiss Type' and reorders it into typographic mayhem yet still withholding its functionality but with expressive tones and textures.Weingart brought an innovative breath of clarity and structure to a dense, complex bulk of information found in the  1980 catalog for Art Basel. His work to this day is seen as the forerunner of modern Graphic Design.</p></h2>

   <h1 id="CONCLUSION">CONCLUSION</h1>

    <section><h2><p>Wolfgang Weingart's typographical legacy is set in stone due to his revolutionary involvement in the field of Typography and Graphic Design. Through his work and teaching, he has influenced the 'New Wave' of modern designers unhindered by the traditional rules of lettering and layout, but instead, given the freedom to express ideas and themselves through the craft of design itself. Weingart's destruction of the traditional norms of type pathed the way for the exploration of limitless possibilities for industry. Some critics at the time believed that Weingart worked in his profession with a cloud of arrogance and an inability to conform.I do not believe that. The truly humbling nature of Weingart's character is that he never forced the exploration of these new ways to explore type upon his students. He simply opened up the realm of possibilities to them and offered his students the chance to experiment with artistic freedom and without the burden of judgment from those that still lingered in the more traditional ways of typography.
